# Enterprise Software Architecture

We affectionately call it **`Elvis`** - a fresh take on **`Nx workspaces`**, standing for:

 **`E`**`nterprise` **`L`**`evel` **`V`**`isionary` **`I`**`nnovation` **`S`**`tack`.

Together, we shall embark on this grand adventure of building it piece by piece, culminating in the complete Elvis manuscript. I say, even **in these AI-driven times**, one mustn't forget the **paramount importance of data quality**: Rubbish in, rubbish out, as they say in the Queen's English.

Hence, we're kicking off with a rather fascinating topic: **"NestJS for Angular Experts"**, where we'll employ **NestJS** as a **middleware solution** to modernise existing **enterprise data**. The impatient chaps among you may skip straight to this section: [NestJS for Angular Developers](articles/Nest.js/Quick-Start-Nx-Angular/pdf).

Should anyone fancy diving into Angular at this juncture, our distinguished colleague [Manfred](https://x.com/ManfredSteyer) would be surely delighted to help. [Daniel](https://x.com/DanielGlejzner) curates a rather splendid [Angular Space](https://x.com/i/communities/1726237719762714636), and I've taken the liberty of compiling a list of other brilliant Angular experts (Arman, Enea, Minko, Thomas,..), which you can peruse here: [Angular Experts](https://x.com/i/lists/1869382100476149875/members).

And one more thing: This is the documentation project. You'll find Elvis here: [github.com/webia1/elvis](https://github.com/webia1/elvis). The Elvis project is in active development. Individual branches serve as checkpoints in our journey. More details on this here: [NestJS for Angular Developers](articles/Nest.js/Quick-Start-Nx-Angular/pdf)

**Updates shall be forthcoming, cross my heart and hope to fly!**

## About the Author

For industry insiders, I need no introduction - I'm a seasoned Software Architect with two decades of **battle scars and success stories**. For those wondering what exactly a Software Architect is, here's my perspective:

- A developer who's weathered **enough production storms** to earn their **disaster-prevention credentials**
- The eccentric who brightens up at the mention of **dependency graphs** at social gatherings (coincidentally, my social calendar has mysterious gaps)
- The pragmatist who evolved from **"it works on my machine"** to **"it works on any machine, anywhere, anytime"**
- A master of **distributed systems** who can architect 50 different scaling solutions but **still misplaces their coffee mug mid-thought**
- The person who **invests 90% of their time** explaining why that **"quick fix"** will evolve into **a slow-motion catastrophe**

Drawing a parallel to "Top Gun: Maverick" - like Tom Cruise's character, I could have pursued the path to a 4-star Admiral like Val Kilmer's "Iceman", but I chose to stay close to **what I love: coding.**

There's something **uniquely energizing** about collaborating with younger developers (perhaps due to a cognitive glitch that has me perpetually feeling 25). I'll keep my self-description brief - I'm here to share experiences and insights with you.

**My goal** is to contribute meaningfully to your journey **in software development & arhitecture**. I've set out to gradually explore **various intriguing topics (particularly crucial in this AI era)** and, **barring any cosmic interventions**, this content **should grow continuously**.

But **you know how it goes with plans** - fate usually has a good laugh at them. Let's see how far this journey takes us.

Until now, I've shared my knowledge **exclusively with Fortune 500 companies** who could afford premium consulting rates. This is **my first venture** into public knowledge sharing - quite a plot twist in my professional story.

**Looking forward to our collaboration,..**

**Me, just one of you** - *not necessarily better, but perhaps more battle-tested*.

p.s. I can take punches and throw them too, but don't worry - there's a heart of gold beneath all that tough love. ;)
